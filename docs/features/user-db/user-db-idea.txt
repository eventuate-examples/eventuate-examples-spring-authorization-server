I want to enhance the authorization server:

Define a UserDatabase Spring profile that has the same configuration as /Users/cer/src/eventuate/eventuate-examples-spring-authorization-server/authorization-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml except that:

* In-memory database (simple hashmap or h2?) for users instead of hardwired single user user/password
* Prepopulated with user/password
* REST API for user CRUD
