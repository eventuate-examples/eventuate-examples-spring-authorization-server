# Eventuate Examples Spring Authorization Server

This repository publishes a version of the Spring Authorization Server for use by the Eventuate example applications.
It has the following features:

* Extends Spring Authorization Server to support password grants
* Test-container extension for using Spring Authorization Server in JUnit tests
*

## Adds support for password grants

This repository adds support for password grants to Spring Authorization Server.
Password grants support the following use cases:

* API Gateway authenticates an API key and secret and generates a JWT that can be passed to downstream services.
* JUnit tests for a service (whose API requires a JWT) can generate a JWT using a password grant.

## Test-container extension for using Spring Authorization Server in JUnit tests

This repository also extends Testcontainers to allow Spring Authorization Server to be used in JUnit tests.
