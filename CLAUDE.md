- JPA entities - that have DB generated IDs - should not have a constructor that has an ID parameter
- Use assert4j for testing
- Don't include comments that point out the obvious: e.g. // ID should be null until persisted
- JPA Don't need setters unless they are required by the domain logic
- Don't write tests for constructors, e.g. testTravelerWithNoArgsConstructor
- Don't add finders to repositories unless they are needed by the business logic
- IMPORTANT do not disable pre-commit hooks
